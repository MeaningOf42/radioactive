# radioactive


This is a small simulation of how radioactive atoms decay. Dots representing undecayed nucleus can be seen floating around the screen untill they decay and disapear. To the left a graph of the total number of undecayed nucleus vs time is shown and updated in real time. This graph can be used to see the negative exponential relationship between time and number of undecayed atoms. This project can be seen working on [github pages](https://meaningof42.github.io/radioactive/).

This project was made for a reddit user who didn't want to pay for a java app that did similar stuff.
